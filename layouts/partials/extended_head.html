<h1>Wildfires in the US</h1>

<h4>The objective of this website is to investigate if there exist a correlation between man-made wildfires and poverty in the US. Other sub-objectives, such as investigating different trends of wildfires and socioeconomics, will also be researched and answered. A prediction of wildfire causes will also be conducted. This will be done with visualization and machine learning tools to get a better understanding of the underlining correlation and facts. </h4>
